    <h1>Hardware </h1>

    <h2>Motherboard</h2>

    <div>The motherboard brings all parts of a computer together. It is how the different parts communicate to each other.</div>
    <h2>CPU</h2>

    <img src="http://gazettereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cpu.png" width="350" height="263" alt="Klematis">
    <div>The CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. It is well known as the “brains” or intellect of a computer. It takes care of the information or directions of a computer. It basically controls everything in your computer.</div>

    <h2>RAM</h2>

    <img src="http://news.techgenie.com/files/RAM2.jpg" width="350" height="263" alt="Klematis">
    <div>RAM stands for random access memory. It is the memory or space for your computer. RAM controls how fast your computer will run. If you have more RAM then you can have more applications and it will run faster.</div>

    <h2>Hard Drive</h2>

    <div>A hard drive is the storage device for your computer. It is where your files are saved to and it stores them.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Communication of Components</h2>

    <img src="http://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/system-bus.png" width="350" height="263" alt="Klematis">
    <div>All the different components communicate with one another through the computer bus. A computer bus includes different materialistic networks such as; wires, cables, etc. It is composed of three contrasting subassemblies including the data bus (conveys
        the guidance of the processor), address bus (transits recollection addresses, which allows the processor to understand data) , and control bus (shifts the signals from the management unit). Also, the leading buses are formulated by the internal
        and expansion bus. The North and South bridge form the chipset, which programs the statistics among the computer bus. This way the components of a computer are able to interact with one another.

    <h2>Keyboard, Mouse,+ Monitor</h2>
