<h2>Favorite Things</h2>
<p style="display:inline-block; width: 65%">My favorite book series is the the lying game. All the suspense and mystery that go on the book excites me and keep me interested in reading the book. My favorite movie is Mean Girls because it's one of the few movies I can watch over and over again and I won't get tired of it. The comedy that goes on in the movie definitely makes it more enjoyable!

<h2>Hobbies + Description</h2>
<p style="display:inline-block; width: 65%">I adore arts and crafts and it's absolutely one of my most loved hobbies. There are just so many different types of art and crafts activities that you can do so you won't get bored. Doing little mini projects, such as decorating something with stickers is my favorite area of arts and crafts. I've always loved doing these things in school since I was in preschool, so that's how I got into it.
